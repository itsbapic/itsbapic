## 🎨 Visual Design

I love creating aesthetically pleasing designs, whether it be web, graphic or motion design. I have worked on several projects where I have been responsible for designing UI/UX. My design philosophy is to make interfaces as simple and intuitive as possible.

## 🎵 Music Production

Music production is my creative outlet. I am a self-taught music producer who has been creating music for over 12 years. I specialize in orchestral electronic, but am always experimenting with new genres. Check out some stuff if you're interested!

## 🏃‍♂️ Running

I have been an avid runner since I was very young, and participate in 5Ks, 10Ks, & half-marathons regularly. Running helps me stay focused, calm, and energized throughout the day.
